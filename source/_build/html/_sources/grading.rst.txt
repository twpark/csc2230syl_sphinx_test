Assignments

Homework
^^^^

Weekly assignments due usually every Wednesday evening, **typed and submitted electronically**. They’ll be posted on Canvas as PDFs along with any necessary files or starter code.

You may discuss/study with others on the homework, but every assignment **MUST BE INDIVIDUAL WORK**. Do not share code with others!


Submission and Late Policy
^^^^

The following procedures apply to all assignments (unless specifically directed otherwise).

* **All assignments must be submitted via Canvas to be accepted**. Each assignment will have a specified due date.
    * Emailed assignments are not accepted.
* Assignments not turned in when they are due are considered late. Late assignments will receive a penalty depending on the number of days delayed:
    * -10% for less than 1 day
    * -20% for less than 2 days
    * -30% for less than 3 days
    * -40% for less than 1 week
    * -50% for more than 1 week
* Late submissions will **NOT** be accepted after Friday, March 15.
* Technical Challenge and Late submissions
    * Friendly Reminder: BE SURE TO ALWAYS BACK-UP YOUR WORK and store incremental copies in multiple places. Flash drives and personal laptops only fail just prior to the due date of programming assignments (or so it seems). The instructor is very unlikely to perceive a storage or system crash as adequate grounds for allowing an extension of a due date!


Quizzes
^^^^

Each Friday there will be a quiz in the last 20 minutes of class. Doing the homework assignments diligently and paying attention in class will be sufficient to score 100%. The final exam will be composed of 3 individual quizzes to be completed during the final exam time.

The lowest 2 quiz grades will be dropped.




General Assignment Policy
^^^^
**All works are individual**: Unless otherwise noted, all work is to be done on an **individual basis**. At the same time, it is understood that learning from your peers is valid and you are encouraged to talk among yourselves about programming in general and current assignments in particular. Keep in mind, however, that each individual student must do the work in order to learn. Hence, the following guidelines are established:

* Feel free to discuss any and all programming assignments.
    * Discussion on Slack in the class channel is encouraged, to share common pattern of troubleshooting experiences and to benefit from each other.
    * However, **DO NOT** allow other students to copy your code.
    * Given that said, **DO NOT** give any student an electronic or printed copy of any program you write for this class.
* Gaining the ability to properly analyze common programming errors is an important experience. 
    * Do not deprive (too early) a fellow student of his/her opportunity to practice problem solving: control the urge to show them what to do by writing the code for them.
    * If you don't know how to do it wisely, ask the instructor or lab tutors to do it.
* If you’ve given the assignment a fair effort and still need help, see the lab tutors or instructor.
* **DOUBLE ZERO for plagiarism**: If there is any evidence that a program or other written assignment was copied from another student, both students will earn 'double zero' credit for the assignment. 
    * That is, zero for the given assignment and another deduction of full credit amount of that assignment.
    * Following the university policy, the act will be automatically reported to department and dean's office.
* Protect yourself: Handle throw-away program listings carefully.
