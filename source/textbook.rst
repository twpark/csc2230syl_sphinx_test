Required Texts
----
* `free` `required` Python for Everybody, by Chuck Severance `py4e.com/book <https://www.py4e.com/book`_
* `paid` `recommended` Python for Data Analysis, 2nd edition, by Wes McKinney 

Software
----
This class will be using Jupyter Notebook for its default Dev Env. If you wish this for your personal laptop, and don't already have it installed, you can obtain it for free from its homepage at `jupyter.org <https://jupyter.org>`_.


Storage Media or Source Repo
----

If you do not already have a USB flash drive for storing and backing up personal files, invest in one!  USB flash drives are available for purchase all over these days, and you can get a lot of storage for pretty reasonable prices!

Otherwise, you may want to learn how to use online/local source code repository toolkits (e.g., git) and keep your codes backed up.
